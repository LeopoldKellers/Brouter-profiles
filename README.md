### Brouter-profiles collection

Trekking Dry is my default trekking profile, being identical to default configuration of Trekking-Poutnik.brf template. It has multiple enhancement wrt reference Trekking.brf.

Trekking Wet is modification of above , penalizing muddy / slicky surfaces.

Trekking MTBs are not really intended to MTB, but rather making trekking routes more MTB-like.

Hiking Beta is still under development, involving wet modes and MTP + SAC difficulty scales. I got a feedback it seems quite useable.
