#### The list of my end user profiles for Android Brouter routing application.



* Click on the profile of your interest, click on the RAW button and either copy the content either save the .BRF file locally.
* You can test the profiles online on [Brouter-web/](http://brouter.de/brouter-web/) by pasting their text content to bottom left paste field + pressing UPLOAD button. It then appears as Custom profile, aside of predefined ones.
* Notice the comments at bottom of profile text.
* @abrensch @nrenner  Feel free to refer to this collection in your resources, or use profiles in Brouter-web / Brouter application.
* See more here [Brouter-profiles-collection](../../wiki/Brouter-profiles-collection).
