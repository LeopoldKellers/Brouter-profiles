#### The list of my end user profiles for Android Brouter routing application.
* The profiles are configured variants of my Trekking/Hiking profile templates. 
* Click on the profile of your interest, click on the RAW button and save the .BRF file locally.
* You can test the profiles online on [Brouter-web/](http://brouter.de/brouter-web/) by pasting their text content to bottom left paste field + pressing UPLOAD button. It then appears as Custom profile, aside of predefined ones.
* Notice the comments at bottom of profile text.
* See more here [Brouter-profiles-collection](https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/wiki/Brouter-profiles-collection).  
* @abrensch @nrenner  Feel free to refer to this collection in your resources.
