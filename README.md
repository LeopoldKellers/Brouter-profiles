#### My end user Trekking/Hiking/car profiles for Android Brouter routing application.

* Download the Archive BR-XXXX-profiles.zip containing all the XXXX profiles and transfer the profiles of the interest to your Profiles2 subfolder of BRouter folders.
 
* Aside of downloading rleased profiles, you can generate those ZIPs anytime from the latest profile templates if on Windows.
* Download this [Windows batchfile on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/master/sedbatch.bat)
* check its prerequisitiesof presence and provided location of sed.exe, wget.exe az 7z.exe utilities.
* run it as "sedbatch all" or just e.g. "sedbatch car" "sedbatch bike" or "sedbatch bike foot"

* You can test the profiles online on [Brouter-web/](http://brouter.de/brouter-web/) by pasting their text content to bottom left paste field + pressing UPLOAD button. It then appears as Custom profile, aside of predefined ones.

* Notice the comments at bottom of profile text.

* @abrensch @nrenner  Feel free to refer to this collection in your resources, or use profiles in Brouter-web / Brouter application.
